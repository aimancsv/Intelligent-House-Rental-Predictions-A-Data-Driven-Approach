**Description:**  
An in-depth analysis of house rental patterns using R, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. The dataset includes 4,747 rows of rental data, and this project examines trends such as rental prices, tenant preferences, and housing attributes. The project also highlights potential extensions into predictive modeling, such as price prediction and tenant behavior analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation studies, area preferences, and monthly rental trends.
- Visualization: Interactive and static plots using ggplot2, plotly, and other libraries.
- AI Potential: Provides a foundation for applying machine learning algorithms, such as clustering or regression models, to predict prices or identify customer preferences.
